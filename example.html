					<p>A gay musical, called Gay. That's quite gay. Gay musical? Aren't all musicals gay? This must be, like, the gayest musical ever. Yes! If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them. When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds. Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on. I mean, they have no respect for us up there! No respect whatsoever! We're all just drudgeons to them! Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. You mean 999. Yes, yes, I mean 999! Yeah, I know. That's the American one, you berk!</p>
        	
					<p>Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? He's had quite an evening. Someone stole his wheelchair. Did you see who it was? Red bearded man. Well that's easy to remember. 0118 999 88199 9119 725! ... 3! It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... Graphic homoeroticism? Does that mean they're going to get them out? Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN!</p>
        	
					<p>I've got Aunt Irma visiting. Oh, do you not like Aunt Irma? I've got an aunt like that. It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing! A story of a young man trying to find his sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years. Warning: Contains scenes of graphic homoeroticism. It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... I've got Aunt Irma visiting. Oh, do you not like Aunt Irma? I've got an aunt like that. You're not comfortable with your sexuality? Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality.</p>

					<p>Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on. Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble. It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... I am a man, he's a man, we're men! Ok, tell me how your feeling. I feel delicate... and annoyed, and... I think I'm ugly. Might want to play a bit hard to get. No, no, that's the music you heard when it come on. Yes! If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them.</p>
        	
					<p>Shut up, do what I tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I dont care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs! I've got Aunt Irma visiting. Oh, do you not like Aunt Irma? I've got an aunt like that. Graphic homoeroticism? Does that mean they're going to get them out? It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend? Dear Sir stroke Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire which has broken out at the premises of... You mean 999. Yes, yes, I mean 999! Yeah, I know. That's the American one, you berk! Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services.</p>
        	
					<p>Graphic homoeroticism? Does that mean they're going to get them out? Dear Sir stroke Madam. Fire, exclamation mark. Fire, exclamation mark. Help me, exclamation mark. 123 Carrendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. All the best, Maurice Moss. If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to carry their food around in my trousers. Oh my God! Before you brought it to their table? No, after! Of course, before! Why would I do it after? I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. A gay musical, called Gay. That's quite gay. Gay musical? Aren't all musicals gay? This must be, like, the gayest musical ever.</p>

When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds. 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. No, that's the music you hear when... I'm sorry are you from the past?</p>

					<p>See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table, so its not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory!
